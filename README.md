# Coq in a Hurry

This repository contains my (rather brief) introduction to the programming language/proof assistant **Coq**. I completed the tutorial [Coq in a Hurry](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00001173v6/document) by Yves Bartot in preparation for my attendance at the [School of Univalent Mathematics in July 2024](https://unimath.github.io/minneapolis2024/).

Much as Coq itself, this repository is licensed under the GNU LGPL.
